NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

INFO:

   Logic has been added to automatically put the DCMs in auto-calibration
   mode if the clock input or clock feedback ever stops. This is recommended
   to ensure that the DCMs will maintain maximum operating frequency for the
   following Virtex-4 devices: Production Step 2 for LX/SX, and all Productions
   for FX.  The extra logic insertion can be disabled by placing the
   DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION=FALSE attribute on each applicable DCM or by setting
   the environment variable XIL_DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_OFF.  For more information
   regarding the DCM auto-calibration mode, please consult Answer Record 21435.
