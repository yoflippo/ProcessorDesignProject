WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <Net fpga_0_DDR_CLK_FB TNM_NET =
   fpga_0_DDR_CLK_FB;> [ml410.ucf(34)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM
   constraint are driven by "fpga_0_DDR_CLK_FB".

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'board_clk', used in period specification
   'TS_board_clk', was traced into DCM_ADV instance
   u1_plasma_top/u0_clk/DCM_BASE0. The following new TNM groups and period
   specifications were generated at the DCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_u1_plasma_top_u0_clk_clk_2x_bufg_in = PERIOD
   "u1_plasma_top_u0_clk_clk_2x_bufg_in" TS_board_clk / 0.791666667 HIGH 50%>

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:194 - The TNM 'fpga_0_DDR_CLK_FB', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMs and is not actively used
   by any referencing constraint.

Done...

INFO:NgdBuild:1222 - Setting CLKIN_PERIOD attribute associated with DCM instance
   u1_plasma_top/u0_clk/DCM_BASE0 to 10.000000 ns based on the period
   specification (<TIMESPEC TS_board_clk = PERIOD "board_clk" 10000 ps;>
